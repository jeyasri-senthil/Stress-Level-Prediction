# *STRESS-LEVEL-PREDICTION*

#### *About Dataset*

“***Humidity*** – ***Temperature*** – ***Step count*** – ***Stress levels***” *represents the columns of the Stress-Lysis.csv file.*

*Based on the human’s physical activity, the stress levels of the human being are detected and analyzed here. A dataset of 2001 samples is provided for human body Humidity, Body Temperature and the Number of Steps taken by the user. Three different classifications of stress are performed, Low Stress, Normal Stress, and High Stress. More information on how this data is analyzed can be found at “L. Rachakonda, S. P. Mohanty, E. Kougianos, and P. Sundaravadivel, “Stress-Lysis: A DNN-Integrated Edge Device for Stress Level Detection in the IoMT,” IEEE Trans. Conum. Electron., vol. 65, no. 4, pp. 474–483, 2019.”*

#### *COLUMN DESCRIPTION*

***Humidity*** - *When you feel stress, your body temperature rises, prompting your sweat glands to kick in. This sweat is considered to be the Humidity Level.*

***Temperature*** - *Body Temperature of a person during stress.*

***Stepcount*** - *Number of steps covered by the person during his stressful situation.*

***Stress_Level*** - *Based on all the above 3 Factors our Stress Level will be predicted as High, Medium and Low accordingly.*

***NOTE: I have attached every file (Dataset, EDA notebook, Loaded Trained model, and The Final Stress Level Prediction Web App code) related to this project in this Repository.***
